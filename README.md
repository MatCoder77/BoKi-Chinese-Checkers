# BoKi-Chinese-Checkers

Chinese Checkers is a board game invented in Germany. The game can be played with two to six players and takes place on a star-shaped board, which consists of a 61-hole central hexagon and six 10-hole equilateral triangles that extend outward from each side. The objective is to move all of the pawns in one's home triangle to the oposite one.

## Implementation details

It's client-server Java application. Server architecture enables many games to take place at the same time. Users can play with each other or with one or more bots.
Project was created by me and my friend @filipbk.
